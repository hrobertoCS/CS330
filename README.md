CS330: Module Eight Journal
     When it comes to designing software, Iâ€™ve learned that starting with a clear plan and simple shapes helps a lot. Through working on the project, I developed better skills in breaking down complex designs into smaller, manageable parts. For my project, I followed a process where I first mapped out the basic shapes and layouts I wanted, then added textures and lighting later. One tactic I found helpful was focusing on functionality first and improving the visual details afterward, which is something I can apply to future projects to stay organized and not get overwhelmed early on.
     When developing programs, I used more structured strategies like building in small pieces and testing often instead of trying to finish big sections all at once. Iteration played a big role because every time I tested my scene, I would notice small things to fix, whether it was object positioning, lighting, or texture issues. My approach definitely improved over time. At the beginning of the course I was more rushed and focused just on getting things to work, but by the end, I cared a lot more about polish and presentation. Learning computational graphics and visualizations gave me new technical skills like working with OpenGL and understanding how rendering works, which I know will help me in future classes and possibly in my career if I go into fields like game development, simulations, or even data visualization.
